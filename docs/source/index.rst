Golem
=================================

Intro
********
Golem is a complete test automation tool and framework for end-to-end testing.
It creates powerful, robust and maintainable test suites, yet, it is easy to pick up and learn even without a lot of programming knowledge.
It is based on Selenium Webdriver and it can be extended using Python.

**It can:**

- Use the Page Object pattern
- Write tests with multi data sets (data-driven)
- Run tests in parallel
- Test APIs
- Run tests remotely (Selenium Grid or a cloud testing provider)
- It can be executed from Jenkins or any other CI tool 


**It has:**

- A complete GUI module (a web application) to write and execute tests
- A reporting engine and a web reports module
- An interactive console


Selenium
********

Some prior knowledge of Selenium is required to work with Golem.
Golem extends Selenium webdriver and webelement classes and uses a simplified interface for finding elements.
It is advised to understand how standard Selenium works.
`This guide <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a good place to start.
